# Levenshtein-distance Calculator 
Analyze the diameter and pair-wise difference of Levenshtein-distance's solution set

**Project Description**

This repository houses an independent research project focused on exploring the solvability of distance profiles in several optimization problems within polynomial time. The project places particular emphasis on the large space of the Levenshtein distance. Key parameters for solution sets were defined, and dynamic programming was utilized to devise a table to record edit-distance information. Through recursive data processing and path planning optimization, the project successfully computes maximum distances and pair-wise differences of the sets. 

This work was conducted under the guidance of Prof. Ran Libeskind-Hadas, whose expertise in computational biology has significantly contributed to the project's development and success.
